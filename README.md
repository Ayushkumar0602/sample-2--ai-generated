# sample 2 

AI-generated project created with AI Code Builder.

## Project Description
Generate a complete, responsive web application in HTML format (using inline JavaScript and inline CSS) that interacts with Firebase. The application should adhere to best security practices and include comprehensive error handling and clear documentation.  The Firebase configuration is as follows:

```json
{
  "storageBucket": "study2-7bdc7.firebasestorage.app",
  "messagingSenderId": "320617984870",
  "authDomain": "study2-7bdc7.firebaseapp.com",
  "appId": "1:320617984870:web:04b61ea4ee88ae057e4ea7",
  "apiKey": "AIzaSyCVYdfql5aqHrChlA1v3nxRLkIbYyWMvUg",
  "projectId": "study2-7bdc7"
}
```

The application architecture is defined as follows:

```json
{
  "collections": [
    "users",
    "notes"
  ],
  "auth": [
    "email/password",
    "google"
  ],
  "pages": [
    "dashboard",
    "profile",
    "note-creation"
  ],
  "functions": [
    "createNote",
    "updateNote",
    "deleteNote"
  ]
}
```

**Specific Page Requirements:**

* **profile:** This page allows a logged-in user to add and update their personal details (e.g., name, email, bio).  This information should be stored in the `users` Firebase collection.  Include input fields for these details, a submit button, and clear feedback to the user (success/error messages).

* **dashboard:** This page is accessible only to logged-in users.  It should include a rich set of features demonstrating interaction with the Firebase database (e.g., displaying a list of notes from the `notes` collection, potentially with filtering and sorting options).  The Firebase configuration should be directly embedded within the HTML code for this page.  Consider features such as user profile display, recent activity, or other relevant dashboard elements.

* **note-creation:** This page allows users to create new notes.  It should include rich text editing capabilities (at minimum, a text area), a title field, and a save button. The `createNote` function should handle saving the note to the `notes` collection in Firebase.  Implement robust error handling for cases such as network issues or database failures.


**General Requirements:**

* **Authentication:** Implement both email/password and Google authentication.
* **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for all Firebase operations, displaying user-friendly error messages.
* **Security:**  Prioritize secure coding practices to protect user data.  Use Firebase security rules effectively to control data access.
* **Responsive Design:** The application must be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
* **Documentation:** Include detailed comments in the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code explaining the purpose and functionality of each section.  The documentation should be comprehensive enough for another developer to understand and maintain the code.
* **Inline Code:** All code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) should be embedded directly within the HTML file.


**Output:**  The AI should generate a single HTML file containing the complete application code, including inline CSS and JavaScript, ready to be deployed directly.  The generated HTML should be well-structured, readable, and follow best practices.  The Firebase configuration should be included directly in the JavaScript code.  The AI should prioritize clean, well-commented code over extensive functionality.  It should focus on fundamental functionality, demonstrating correct interaction with Firebase and security practices.
